# SMT

This extension provides syntax highlighting for SMT-LIB and its extensions through TextMate grammar.

## Project structure

* `package.json` - this is the manifest file which declares the language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into the extension.
* `syntaxes/smt.tmLanguage.yaml` - this is the main Text mate grammar file. Edit this file to modify the grammar.
* `syntaxes/smt.tmLanguage.json` - this is the generated file that is used for tokenization. DO NOT edit this file.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

## Get up and running straight away

0. Open a terminal window in the source directory and run `npm install`.
1. Press `F5` to open a new window with the `SMT` extension loaded.
2. Open or create a file with `.smt2` or `.sy` name suffix.
3. Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

* Modify `syntaxes/smt.tmLanguage.yaml` to change the syntax highlight.
* Relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar to load your changes.
